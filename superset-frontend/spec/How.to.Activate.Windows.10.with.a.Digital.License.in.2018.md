A product key is a 25-character code that you enter when you install Windows 10 or upgrade from an older version. A digital license is a method of activation that does not require you to enter a product key, but instead links your Windows 10 installation to your Microsoft account.
 
In this article, we will explain how to activate Windows 10 with a digital license in 2018, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using this method.
 
## What is a digital license?
 
A digital license (also called a digital entitlement in Windows 10 Version 1511) is a new way of activating Windows 10 that was introduced in 2016. It is based on your device's hardware and your Microsoft account, rather than a product key.
 
If you upgraded to Windows 10 for free from an eligible device running a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you automatically got a digital license. If you bought a new PC running Windows 10, it also came with a digital license. If you bought a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store app or online, you also received a digital license.
 
You can check if you have a digital license by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation. If you see "Windows is activated with a digital license" or "Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account", then you have a digital license.
 
## How to activate Windows 10 with a digital license?
 
If you have a digital license, activating Windows 10 is very easy. You just need to sign in with the same Microsoft account that you used to purchase or upgrade to Windows 10. This will link your digital license to your device and your account, and activate Windows 10 automatically.
 
If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create one for free at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com). Then, sign in with your new account on your device and follow the instructions to link your digital license.
 
If you already have a Microsoft account but you are not signed in on your device, you can do so by going to Settings > Accounts > Your info and clicking on "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead". Then, enter your email and password and follow the steps to link your digital license.
 
## What are the benefits of using a digital license?
 
One of the main benefits of using a digital license is that you don't need to keep track of your product key or enter it every time you reinstall or reset Windows 10. Your digital license is stored on Microsoft's servers and can be retrieved automatically when you sign in with your Microsoft account.
 
Another benefit of using a digital license is that it allows you to reactivate Windows 10 if you make a significant hardware change, such as replacing your motherboard or hard drive. This is especially useful if you have a retail license that can be transferred to another device. To do this, you need to use the Activation troubleshooter in Settings > Update & Security > Activation > Troubleshoot. This will detect your hardware change and let you select the device that you want to reactivate.
 
## What are the drawbacks of using a digital license?
 
One of the drawbacks of using a digital license is that it depends on your internet connection and your Microsoft account. If you don't have internet access or if you forget your Microsoft account password, you may not be able to activate Windows 10 or access some features that require activation.
 
Another drawback of using a digital license is that it may not work if you change too many hardware components at once or if you use your Microsoft account on multiple devices. This may trigger an activation error that prevents you from using Windows 10 normally. In this case, you may need to contact Microsoft support or buy a new product key.
